You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description, using any language you may know.
A tourist wants to make a good trip at the weekend with his friends.

They will go to the mountains to see the wonders of nature, so he needs to pack well for the trip.

He has a good knapsack for carrying things, but knows that he can carry a maximum of only 4kg in it,   and it will have to last the whole day.

He creates a list of what he wants to bring for the trip but the total weight of all items is too much.

He then decides to add columns to his initial list detailing their weights and a numerical value representing how important the item is for the trip.
